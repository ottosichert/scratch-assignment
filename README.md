# Scratch assignment

This repository contains an implementation of a probability-based game "Scratch". It's built on JDK 21 and uses Gradle.

The instructions can be found in [ASSIGNMENT.md](ASSIGNMENT.md).

## Usage

## Configuration

The board is set up with symbols, probabilities, rewards and bonuses. 

## Assumptions

Various statements can be interpreted in different ways, so this is a list of decisions taken during the first implementation. Later revisions can adapt or revert certain assumptions.

- There can only be one bonus on the board.
